Hi there, I'm Ryan. A data scientist passionate about computational social science. I specialize in building systems for understanding social and economic systems, ranging from predictive modelling to causal inference, often involving a variety of social science indicators. I also build hobby projects which revolve around raspberry-pi, localized data use-cases and lightweight LLMs. 

It's an exciting time to be alive. The joy of building and learning has never been stronger. Let's make it useful, for all of us, together.
